# SteeringWheel
This is an individual hobby project. My goal is to build a functional steering wheel that can be used for playing racing games. Furthermore I want to make as little as possible use of micro processors and other chips. Most of the circuitry will be built using breadboards, wires and electrical components.   

Functionalities of the first version of the wheel:
-It must connect to a computer via a usb cable. The data must be correctly interpreted and sent.  
-It must detect how far the wheel is rotated and send this data to the computer.  
-The structure must stand on its own and be sturdy.  
-No wires must get stuck while rotating the wheel.  

Other requirements:
-Code and tests must be documented.  
-Wires must be color coded.  
-All circuitry must have a digital version in a simulator.  
-All decisions must be documented.  
-All time spent on the project must be documented.  
-All electrical components used must be documented.
